# keyboard-lock-script
This Python script utilizes the `ctypes` and `pynput` libraries to lock the keyboard input and prevent any accidental keystrokes. It's particularly useful in scenarios where non-users, like toddlers or pets, might come into contact with the keyboard, ensuring that their playful activities don't cause unintended actions on the computer.
